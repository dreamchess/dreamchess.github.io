Unicode support has been added. If you'd like to try it out, please
grab a development build from the [Downloads]({{ site.baseurl }}/downloads) page.
All translations (complete and partial) are enabled in this build.
If you would like to help out and improve any of these translations
or add a new one, please visit
[Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/dreamchess/dreamchess/).

Note: At this time there is no support for right-to-left script, but we are
looking into that.
