title: Translators needed

For the next version of DreamChess, we'd like to add support for localization.
If you'd like to see DreamChess in your language, please head on over to
[Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/dreamchess/dreamchess/) and
improve one of the existing translations or add a new one!

Note: Our font rendering code only supports the Latin-1 character set at
this time. However, feel free to add non-Latin-1 translations to Weblate. We
are planning to add support for unicode in a future version.
